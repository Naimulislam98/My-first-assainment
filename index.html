            <h1>More In Need</h1>
            <p>Last month, a devastating flash flood struck the northeastern districts of Sylhet and Sunamganj in
                Bangladesh. The continuous heavy rainfall in the north-eastern Indian region terribly affected more than
                2 million people who live on the Surma-Kushiyara riverâ€™s bank of Bangladesh. Kanaighat, Gowainghat,
                Companyganj, Jaintapur, Zakiganj, Sylhet sadar, Fenchuganj, and many more upazillas of Sylhet as well as
                several upazilas of Sunamganj and Netrokona districts have been inundated.</p>
